## Frontend Nanodegree MyReads Project

This is my solution to the MyReads project of the react nanodegree from Udacity. The project is to build a book tracking app that that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read with ReactJS.

### Installation
To get the project running on your local machine firstly take a clone of this repo onto your local machine. Then `cd` into the root directory on your CLI tool(eg. CMD prompt or Terminal) and then run `npm install`. This will install all the node packages you require to run the project.

```
npm install
```

### How to Run

The project is bootstrapped with create react app. You can follow the below mentioned methods to run the website depending on the build you prefer.

 _Note:_ `cd` into the root folder on your CLI tool and then run the commands.

To run the devolopment build with auto reload use the following command:
```
npm start
```

To run the production build use the following command:
```
npm run build
serve -s build
```

### How to Build for production

To get the production build use the following command from the root folder:
```
npm run build
```

This command will optimize the files and output it to the **build** folder. Use the contents of this folder for your production hosting.
